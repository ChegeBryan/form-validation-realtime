Note that this version of the demo is strictly written in ES6. The `gulpfile.babel.js` file requires `gulp>=3.9` to run the gulp tasks, as it is written in ES6. To get things working, run `npm install gulp && npm install gulp -g` to update to a version not lesser than `3.9`. There's a `gulp transpile` task which basically transpiles the ES6 code to ES5.
